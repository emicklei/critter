<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
    A rule can have actions that change the request, headers, body or those of the response.
    All its actions are performed in the order as listed in the rule.
    A rule has a name and can be disabled. Rules are defined in XML.
    Rules are managed (crud) using the REST interface of the traffic service.
