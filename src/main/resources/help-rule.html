<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
  A rule can have actions that change the request, headers, body or those of the response.
  All its actions are performed in the order as listed in the rule.
  A rule has a name and can be disabled. Rules are defined in XML.
  Rules are managed (crud) using the REST interface of the traffic service.
</p>

<h4>Basic structure of a Rule</h4>
<pre>
&lt;rule id=&quot;my-rule&quot; order=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;conditions&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/conditions&gt;
    &lt;actions&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/actions&gt;    
&lt;/rule&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Prioritizing rules</h4>

<p>
  Rules can be prioritized by adding the 'order' attribute with a numerical value to the rule. The ordering is based on the lowest value, where 1 is more important than 2.
  <br/>
  If a rule has no order, it will be given the highest value possible.
</p>

<h4>Rules matching order</h4>

<p>
  For each request, the best matching rule is selected. This means that the rule with the most matching conditions is returned. If 2 rules match on conditions, the one with the lowest value
  for the 'order' field is used.
